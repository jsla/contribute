          <p class='f4 lh-copy measure'>
            Our talks are 30 minutes in length. Usually, this is 20-25 minutes of content followed by 5-10 minutes of Q+A. We've found this to be long enough for good detail while being short enough to hold the audience's attention. This length is also great for online -- just about the right duration for someone to watch during lunch or a coffee break.
          </p>

          <p class='f4 lh-copy measure'>
          If you intend to promote a product, app, service, or technology, be careful. It's important that your talk does not come across as a sales pitch. Consider giving a behind the scenes look at your work or take the audience on your journey that led to where you are now. Feature tours do not make good talks.
          </p>

          <p class='f4 lh-copy measure'>
            The best talks are focused on a personal experience. A great format for this is a three part story:
            <ol>
              <li>What did you want and why?</li>
              <li>What different things did you try and why? How did that turn out for you?</li>
              <li>What did you learn? What surprised you? If you could go back in time, what would you tell yourself before starting?</li>
